# dudes
This is a dudes project

50 balls are generated each with a 50 percent chance of being a chaser and a 50 percent chance of being a runner. However, chasers can eat chasers and runners, and runners can eat chasers and runners as well, it all depends of who the bigger ball is. The balls detect each other when they are a distance of, 200 plus the radius of the detected ball(this gives smaller balls an advantage when running), or closer and if the ball is a chaser, it moves towards the largest detected ball that is smaller than itself. A runner moves away from the largest detected ball that is larger than itself. Each ball is numbered between 0 and 49. The chasing dudes start off generally smaller and slower than then running dudes because they have the advantage of giving chase. Orange is chase, grey is running.

The white dude is the player you can move it using arrow keys, it always is number 49 and starts with radius 15

Who will be the last one alive?
